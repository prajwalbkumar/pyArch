# Welcome to pyArch Tools Documentation

The **pyArch Tools** suite is designed to streamline and automate various tasks within Revit, enhancing productivity and ensuring accuracy across your projects. This documentation page is your go-to resource for understanding how to use these tools effectively, common issues you might encounter, troubleshooting tips, and quick video tutorials to guide you through each tool.

Our tools are organized into several key categories, each addressing different aspects of your project workflow:

#### **Initialization**

Kickstart your project setup efficiently with tools like **Create Worksets, Custom Worksets**, and **Assign Worksets**. The **DAR Startup** tool ensures that your project begins with the right configurations and templates.

#### **Signage**

Manage your signage with ease using tools like **Place Identification Signage**, **Modify Signage Numbers**, **Signage Count**, and **Renumber Signage**. These tools help you maintain consistency and accuracy in signage throughout your project.

#### **FLS and Acoustic**

Ensure compliance with Fire Life Safety (FLS) and Acoustic standards using tools such as **FLS\_STC Ratings to Walls, FLS\_STC\_Wall Type Checker**, and **Travel Distances and Dead Ends and Common Path of Travel**. These tools simplify the process of validating your design against critical safety and acoustic requirements.

#### **Doors**

Our door management tools, including **Add Room Type Parameter, Copy Room Type Data, Room Data Checks**, and **Door Detective**, are designed to streamline door data management and compliance checks. Tools like **Fire Rating Check** and **STC Rating Check** ensure that your doors meet the required standards, while **FLS Compliance Validator** and **Purge Validated Data** help maintain data integrity.

#### **Modelling Aids**

Enhance your modeling efficiency with tools such as **Delete Unplaced Rooms, Remove Identical Elements**, and **Door Wall Room Base**. These aids simplify routine tasks and improve accuracy, allowing you to focus on the creative aspects of your project.

#### **Analysis**

Leverage tools like **Staircase Clearances**, **MEP\_Wet Area Clashes**, and **Occupancy Calculator** to perform critical analyses within your models, ensuring that design considerations are met effectively.

#### **Pre-Publish Checks**

Before finalizing your model, use **Purge File**, **Remove CAD**, and **Save Detach to PCW** to clean up and optimize your file for delivery, ensuring it meets the highest standards of quality.

#### **Model Validation**

The **URS Validator** ensures that your model aligns with the User Requirements Specification, catching any discrepancies before they become issues.

#### **Document Verification**

Verify your documents against standards with **WI vs LOD** to ensure consistency in your project’s level of detail.

#### **Dimensioning**

Automate dimensioning tasks with tools like **Dimension Grid** and **Overall Room Dimension**, ensuring precision in your project’s measurements.

#### **Cleanup**

Keep your project organized with tools like **Relocate Room Tags, Align Grids, Align Levels**, and **Flip Grid Bubbles**, which help maintain clarity and consistency throughout your model.

#### **View Generation**

Generate detailed views effortlessly with tools such as **Advanced Plan, Advanced Section, Advanced Elevation, Advanced Acoustic Plan**, and **Advanced FLS Plan**. These tools are designed to provide the detailed documentation required for comprehensive project management.

#### **Aluminum Schedules**

Create schedules automatically with the **Auto Schedules** tool, saving you time and reducing the potential for errors.

#### **eLOD**

Manage your project’s level of detail with the **ARiLOD, AI-AGiLOD, COBieParam**, and **NEOMParam** tools, ensuring your model meets the required standards and specifications.
